# Data integration challenge


Welcome to Data API challenge.

Yawoen company has hired you to implement a Data API. 

## The challenge

### 1 - Load company data in a database

Read data from CSV file and load into the database to create an entity named **companies**.

This entity should contain the following fields: id, company name and zip code. 

suport file: q1_catalog.csv


### 2 - An API to integrate data using a database

Yawoen company started to capture website data from another source and want to integrate it with the entity you've just created on the database. When possible, it's mandatory that the data are merged.

This new source data has the following input protocol:

- Data treatment
 - **Name:** upper case text
 - **zip:** a five digit text
 - **website:** lower case text

- Input file format: CSV

- Parameters:

    - Name: string
    - Zip: string 
    - Website: string

Build an API to **integrate** `website` data field into the entity records you've just created using **HTTP protocol**.

The data source doesn't provide the id field, so you'll have to use the available fields to aggregate the new attribute **website** and store it. If the record doesn't exists, discard it.

suport file: q2_clientData.csv


### Extra - Matching API to get data based on specified parameters

Now a Yawoen wants to create an API to provide information getting companies information from the entity for a client. 
The parameters would be `name` and `zip` code fields. To query on the database an **AND** logic operator must be used between the fields.

You will need to have a matching strategy because the client might have only a part of the company name. 
For example: "Yawoen" string from "Yawoen Business Solutions".

Ouput example: 
 ```
 {
 	"id": "abc-1de-123fg",
 	"name": "Yawoen Business Solutions",
 	"zip":"10023",
 	"website": "www.yawoen.com"
 }
 ```

## Notes


- More than one instance of the application will serve HTTP requests at the same time.
- Make sure other programmers can easily run the application locally.
- Yawoen doesn't care about the language, the database and other tools that you might choose however make sure your decisions take notice of the market. For example, Brainfuck might not be a good decision.
- Automated tests are mandatory.
- Document your API if you are willing to.


## Deliverable


- It would be REALLY nice if it was hosted in a git repo of your own. You can create a new empty project, create a branch and Merge Request it to the master branch. Provide the MR URL for us. BUT if you'd rather, just compress this directory and send it back to us.
- Make sure Yawoen folks will have access to the source code.
- Fill the **Makefile** targets with the apropriated commands (**TODO** tags).

Have fun!
